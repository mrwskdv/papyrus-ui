# Autocomplete

A component that provides suggestions to the user as they
type.

## When to use

- Large set of possible values: Autocomplete can help reduce
  the number of options that users need to sift through, making it easier for them
  to find what they're looking for.

- Enforcing Consistency: Autocomplete can enforce consistency
  by presenting only valid options to the user, helping to prevent spelling errors
  or other mistakes.

- Saving time: Autocomplete can save users time by reducing
  the amount of typing they need to do and by providing suggestions that are
  relevant to what they're looking for.

- Complex data entry: Autocomplete can be useful for complex data entry,
  such as entering addresses or product names, where a pre-defined list
  of options can simplify the process for the user.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Multiple

The `multiple` property allows multiple values to be selected. Users will see tags displaying the selected values.

<Canvas of={Multiple} />

### Sizes

The `size` property can be used to specify the size of the input box. Available values are `sm`, `md`, and `lg`.

<Canvas of={Sizes} />

### With Icon

Use `startIcon` and `endIcon` properties to add icons to the input box.

<Canvas of={WithIcon} />

### Description

Displays description above the input. The description can be used for additional information or instructions for the
user.

<Canvas of={Description} />

### Message

Displays a hint message below the input. This message can be used as a lower-priority feedback when no validation error
has been occurred.

<Canvas of={Message} />

### Invalid

Setting the `invalid` property to `true` indicates an error or issue with the input value.

<Canvas of={Invalid} />



### Disabled

Disabled input

<Canvas of={Disabled} />

### Read Only

Readonly input

<Canvas of={ReadOnly} />

## Guidelines

- When no suggestions are available because of an error, provide clear error
  feedback using `loadingError` property.

- Provide placeholder text that contains a brief description of what the input
  field is for and what type of information is expected using `placeholder`
  property.

- Use localized values for text that is accessible for the user or screen
  readers. Use these properties to provide custom labels: `clearLabel`,
  `loadingLabel`, and `noResultLabel`.

- Use **`label`** property to provide a label for the input.

- Use **`description`**property to provide additional context or instructions for the input.

- Display helpful hints with the `message` prop or error messages with `invalid` for user guidance, especially in form
  validation scenarios.

## Accessibility

Autocomplete is implemented as part of a [combobox pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/combobox)
defined in WAI ARIA Practices.
