# CheckboxGroup

The `CheckboxGroup` component is used to group multiple checkboxes into a single unit. It provides a way to manage the selection of checkboxes, with support for different layouts and validation states.

## When to use

Use the `CheckboxGroup` component when you have multiple checkboxes that belong to the same group and you need to manage their selection. It supports both single and multiple checkbox selections, layout configurations (row/column), and various validation and accessibility features.

## Examples


### Single Checkbox

The `CheckboxGroup` component with a single checkbox, where the value is a boolean (`true` or `false`). This is useful for cases like agreeing to terms and conditions.

<Canvas of={SingleCheckbox} />


### Row Layout

Displays checkboxes horizontally in a row layout. This layout is often used when you need to align checkboxes next to each other.

<Canvas of={RowLayout} />


### Block Layout

Ensures that the checkboxes take up equal space when displayed in a row layout. This layout is useful when you want the checkboxes to be equally distributed across the container.

<Canvas of={BlockLayout} />


### Column Layout

Displays the checkboxes vertically in a column layout. This layout is often used when you have a list of options or a
form.

<Canvas of={ColumnLayout} />

### Description

The `CheckboxGroup` component with description displayed above the group. The description can be used for additional
information or instructions for the user.

<Canvas of={Description} />

### Invalid

Displays an error message below the checkbox group when the group is marked as invalid. This is typically used for form
validation.

<Canvas of={ErrorMessage} />

### Message

The `CheckboxGroup` component with a hint message displayed below the group. This message can be used as a
lower-priority feedback when no validation error has been occurred.

<Canvas of={Message} />


### Disabled

Disables the entire checkbox group, preventing any interaction with the checkboxes. This is useful when you want to make
the checkboxes non-interactive.

<Canvas of={Disabled} />


### ReadOnly

The `CheckboxGroup` component with checkboxes in a read-only state. This ensures that users cannot interact with the
checkboxes while still allowing them to view the selected options.

<Canvas of={ReadOnly} />


## Guidelines

- The `Checkbox` component should always be used as a child of the `CheckboxGroup` component.

- When the `CheckboxGroup` contains a single checkbox, the `defaultValue` or `value` prop
  should be explicitly set as a boolean (`true` or `false`). This ensures proper behavior, as a boolean value is
  expected for single checkbox selection.

- Choose the appropriate layout based on the design needs. Use `row` when the checkboxes need
  to be aligned horizontally and `column` when they should be stacked vertically.

- Use **`label`** to provide a label for the checkbox group.

- Use **`description`** to provide additional context or instructions for the checkbox group.

- Display helpful hints with the `message` prop or error messages with `invalid` for user guidance, especially in form
  validation scenarios.
