# Table

A versatile and customizable table component used to display structured data in rows and columns. This component supports features like striped rows, borders, and customizable sizes for improved usability and aesthetics.

## When to Use

The `Table` component is ideal for displaying tabular data in a clean and organized manner. It is commonly used for:

- **Data display:** Show structured information, such as lists, datasets, and statistics.
- **Reports:** Display detailed reports with headers, rows, and columns.
- **Comparison data:** Compare items, products, or values in a side-by-side format.
- **Interactive tables:** Use with filters, sorting, and pagination for better data interaction.

## Examples

### Basic

A simple table with borders and a striped row style.

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Sizes

Use the `size` prop to adjust the table's size. Available values are `sm` and `md`. The size affects padding and spacing.

<Canvas of={Sizes} />

### Striped

Enable the `striped` prop to alternate the row colors for better readability.

<Canvas of={Striped} />

### Bordered

The `bordered` prop adds borders around each individual cell, not just the row separators. This makes each cell clearly distinguishable for better visual organization.

<Canvas of={Bordered} />

## Guidelines

- **Table size:** Use `sm` for compact tables and `md` for standard tables. The size affects the internal padding and spacing, allowing for flexible layout design.
- **Borders and Stripes:** When using `bordered`, consider whether you want to visually separate each cell. `striped` rows improve readability, especially in large tables with many rows.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure each header (`<th>`) is descriptive and corresponds to its column's data for accessibility purposes. The table should be usable with screen readers, and consider using ARIA roles for better accessibility.
