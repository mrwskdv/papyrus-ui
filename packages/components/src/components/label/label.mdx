# Label

The Label component is used to represent text in forms or UI elements that typically describe or provide context to an
input field.

## When To Use

Use the Label component to provide clear and accessible labels for form fields such as input, select, or textarea
elements.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

### Truncate Long Text

You can enable text truncation to handle overflow text with an ellipsis (...).

<Canvas of={TruncateLongText} />

### Colored Text

Use `color` property to use different color from the theme.

<Canvas of={ColoredText} />

### Highlighted text

Use `highlight` property to highlight text with a gradient defined in theme.

<Canvas of={HighlightText} />

## Guidelines

- Ensure that labels are short, clear, and to the point. This helps users quickly understand the purpose of the input
  field or element the label is describing.

- If the label text is not associated with a form control, change the rendered html tag to another using `as` prop

## Accessibility

Labels should always be programmatically associated with form elements by using the for attribute or ensuring proximity
in the DOM structure.
