# OList

The OList component is used to create ordered lists. It is a wrapper for the `<ol>` element.

## When to use

- Step-by-Step Instructions: Ordered lists are often used to present a sequence of steps or instructions, such
  as cooking recipes or DIY tutorials.

- Procedural Documentation: Technical documentation and user manuals frequently use ordered lists to outline procedures,
  ensuring users follow a specific sequence of actions.

- Tutorials and Guides: Educational content, tutorials, and guides often employ ordered lists to structure information
  in a logical order.

- Table of Contents: In longer documents or books, ordered lists are used to create a table of contents, providing
  an organized overview of the content's structure.

- Legal Documents: Legal documents, contracts, and agreements may use ordered lists to outline clauses, terms,
  or articles.

- Reference Lists: Create reference lists, citation lists, or bibliographies that require a specific ordering of sources
  or references.

- Timelines: Display chronological events or historical timelines using ordered lists with numeric or date-based labels.

- Survey Questions: In questionnaires and surveys, ordered lists can be used to present questions in a structured order.

- Ordered Rankings: Display ranked items, such as top 10 lists, leaderboards, or priority lists, with numeric labels.

- Sequential Data: When presenting sequential data, like numbered sections of a document, ordered lists ensure
  a consistent numbering scheme.

- Mathematical Sequences: Ordered lists are used to represent mathematical sequences or series, indicating the order
  of terms.

## Examples

### Basic

<Canvas of={Basic} />

The OList component applies `list-decimal` style by default for decimal numbering, along with consistent spacing styles. To use a different numbering style, you can override with Tailwind CSS utilities.

### Custom Numbering Styles

To apply specific numbering styles, you can use Tailwind CSS utilities:

<Canvas of={WithCustomNumbering} />

### Small Text

For smaller text, use the 'sm' size:

<Canvas of={SmallText} />

### Font Variants

You can switch between the primary and secondary font families using the `fontVariant` prop.

#### Primary Font (default)

<Canvas of={PrimaryFont} />

#### Secondary Font

<Canvas of={SecondaryFont} />

### Bold Text

Use `bold` property for bold text.

## Guidelines

- **List Item Content**: Use ListItem component to wrap list item content in `<li>` element. Each list item should contain
  a single item of content or a group of related content.

- **Numbering Styles**: The component applies `list-decimal` by default. To customize numbering styles (alphabetical, Roman numerals, or no numbering), use Tailwind CSS utilities or custom styles. For example:
  - Use `list-[lower-alpha]` for alphabetical numbering
  - Use `list-[lower-roman]` for lowercase Roman numerals
  - Use `list-[upper-roman]` for uppercase Roman numerals
  - Use `list-none` to remove numbering

- **List Length**: Keep ordered lists to a reasonable length. If a list becomes too long, consider breaking it into smaller
  sub-lists or sections for improved comprehension.

- **Nesting**: You can nest ordered lists within other ordered lists or within unordered lists. This is useful
  for representing hierarchies or sub-steps.

## Accessibility

- **Semantic Structure**: Use ordered lists when the sequence or order of items is semantically meaningful. Don't use
  ordered lists for content that doesn't require a specific sequence.

- **Use List Elements**: Wrap each list item in `<li>` (list item) elements. Never use list-style markers (e.g., numbers,
  letters) manually without the proper list structure.
