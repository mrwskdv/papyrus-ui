# RadioGroup

The `RadioGroup` component is used to group multiple radio buttons into a single unit, ensuring that only one option can
be selected at a time. It provides a way to manage the selection of radio buttons, with support for different layouts
and validation states.

## When to use

Use the `RadioGroup` component when you need to present multiple options and only allow one selection. Common use cases
include questions where users can select one option from a list, such as selecting a payment method, subscription type,
or gender. This component ensures that the selection is exclusive within the group.

## Examples

### Row Layout

Displays radio buttons horizontally in a row layout.

<Canvas of={RowLayout} />

### Block Layout

Ensures that the radio buttons take up equal space when displayed in a  full-width row layout.

<Canvas of={BlockLayout} />

### Column Layout

Displays the radio buttons vertically in a column layout.

<Canvas of={ColumnLayout} />

### Description

The `RadioGroup` component with description displayed above the group. The description can be used for additional
information or instructions for the user.

<Canvas of={Description} />

### Error Message

Displays an error message below the radio button group when the group is marked as invalid. This is typically used for
form validation.

<Canvas of={ErrorMessage} />

### Hint

The `RadioGroup` component with a hint message displayed below the group. This message can be used as a lower-priority
feedback when no validation error has occurred.

<Canvas of={Message} />

### Disabled

Disables the entire radio group, preventing any interaction with the radio buttons. This is useful when you want to make
the radio buttons non-interactive.

<Canvas of={Disabled} />

### ReadOnly

The `RadioGroup` component with radio buttons in a read-only state. This ensures that users cannot interact with the
radio buttons while still allowing them to view the selected option.

<Canvas of={ReadOnly} />

## Guidelines

- The `Radio` component should always be used as a child of the `RadioGroup` component. A
  `RadioGroup` is meant to contain multiple radio buttons, and only one can be selected at a time. It should not be used
  for a single radio button, as this defeats the purpose of grouping options with exclusive selections.

- When the `RadioGroup` component is used, it should contain multiple radio buttons, and the user
  should only be able to select one option.

- Choose the appropriate layout based on the design needs. Use `row` when the radio buttons
  need to be aligned horizontally and `column` when they should be stacked vertically.

- Use **`label`** property to provide a label for the radio group.

- Use **`description`**property to provide additional context or instructions for the radio group.

- Display helpful hints with the `message` prop or error messages with `invalid` for user guidance, especially in form
  validation scenarios.
