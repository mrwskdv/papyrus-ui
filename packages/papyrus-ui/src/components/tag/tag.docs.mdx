# Tag

A visual element designed to represent a discrete piece of information or a user-selected category. A Tag typically
displays a small area that conveys a specific label or tag associated with an item, attribute, or action in the user
interface.

## When to use

- Filtering Content: Tags are often used in interfaces where content needs to be filtered based on specific criteria or
  categories. Users can click on tags representing different attributes, characteristics, or topics to filter and view
  content that matches those tags.

- User Profile Skills/Interests: Tags are frequently employed in user profile settings to represent a user's skills,
  interests, or expertise. Users can add tags to their profiles to showcase their areas of expertise, hobbies, or
  professional skills. his helps in creating a more detailed and personalized user profile.

- Content Tagging in Blogging or CMS: Tags are often used in blogging or content management systems to tag content with
  specific topics, categories, or keywords. This helps in organizing content and making it easier for users to find
  content that matches their interests.

### Removable

Use the `onRemove` prop to make the tag removable. This adds a close button (Ã—) to the tag that users can click to remove it. The `Del` key will also trigger the remove action when the tag is focused.

### Removable and Clickable

Combine both `onClick` and `onRemove` props to create a tag that can be both clicked for navigation/selection and removed when no longer needed. This is perfect for filter tags or selected items that users might want to interact with or remove.

## Guidelines

- **Accessibility**: When `onClick` or `onRemove` props are provided, the role is automatically set to `button` and `tabindex` is set to `0`. You don't need to provide these props manually unless you have specific accessibility requirements.

- **Color Contrast**: Ensure that colors provided in variant styles have sufficient contrast ratio for accessibility compliance.

- **Icon Usage**: Icons should be meaningful and help users understand the tag's purpose or content type. Use consistent iconography throughout your application.

- **Interactive Behavior**:
  - Clickable tags are great for navigation, filtering, or selection
  - Removable tags work well for filters, selected items, or temporary states
  - Combined functionality is perfect for complex interactions like filter management

- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tags with `onClick` handlers are focusable and respond to `Enter` and `Space` keys. Tags with `onRemove` handlers also respond to the `Delete` key.

- **Size Selection**: Choose the appropriate size based on your content density and visual hierarchy:
  - `sm`: For compact interfaces or when space is limited
  - `md`: Standard size for most use cases
  - `lg`: For emphasis or when tags contain longer text
